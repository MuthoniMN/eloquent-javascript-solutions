Use the `reduce` method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays.

```
let arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]];
// Your code here.
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Pseudocode 
1. loop through the array and add them together
2. return the new array
